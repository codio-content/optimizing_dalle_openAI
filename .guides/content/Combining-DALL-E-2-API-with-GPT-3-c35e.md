### For Text-to-Image and Image-to-Text Applications

In this section, we will discuss how to combine the DALL-E 2 API with GPT-3 to create powerful text-to-image and image-to-text applications. By leveraging the strengths of both models, you can build more versatile and interactive applications.

## Text-to-Image Application

A text-to-image application translates a given text prompt into an image. You can use GPT-3 to refine the text prompts before passing them to the DALL-E 2 API for image generation. Here's an example:

Use GPT-3 to create a more descriptive text prompt based on user input:

```python
import os
import openai
from PIL import Image,ImageOps
from io import BytesIO
import secret

# Set API key and prompt
openai.api_key = secret.key

user_input = "Create an image of a car"

# Generate more descriptive text with GPT-3
response = openai.Completion.create(
    engine="text-davinci-002",
    prompt=f"Create a more descriptive scene based on this user input: '{user_input}'.",
    max_tokens=50,
    n=1,
    stop=None,
    temperature=0.7,
)

descriptive_text = response.choices[0].text.strip()
print(descriptive_text)

```

The code above gets a user input, then uses GPT-3 to expand on that prompt. How to go about expanding on the prompt is by writing the following prompt :  `Create a more descriptive scene based on this user input:`.

Now let's try creating and saving the image that we would generate from our new and more detailed prompt. 

```python
# Generate the base image
response = openai.Image.create(
    prompt=descriptive_text,
    n=1,
    size="512x512"
)

image_url = response['data'][0]['url']

img_data = requests.get(image_url).content
with open('base_img.jpg', 'wb') as handler:
    handler.write(img_data)

```

Once you found an image or prompt you are comfortable working with. We are going to save on some tokens and copy the prompt being printed and set our variable `descriptive_text` equal to it. From that point please comment out GPT code. 

Below is an example of a descriptive text generated by the AI. Feel free to run it.
```python
descriptive_text = "The car is a sleek, silver convertible with bright red leather seats. It's parked in front of a beautiful mansion with a fountain in the middle."
```

### Temperature
In our code, we used the `temperature` with the value of `0.7`. Temperature is a parameter that influences the randomness of the image generation process. A higher temperature value results in more diverse and potentially more creative prompts, while a lower temperature value produces more conservative and focused results.
