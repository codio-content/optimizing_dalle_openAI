# Generate Image with GPT and DALL-E API

**Objective**: Write a Python function `generate_image(prompt)` that uses OpenAI's GPT API to enhance a user's text prompt and DALL-E API to generate an image based on that enhanced text, then saves this image as `my_img.png`.

**Function Requirements:**

Your function `generate_image(prompt)` should accomplish the following steps:

1. Accept a user's prompt as an argument.
2. Refine this prompt by passing it to the GPT API.
3. Generate an image from the refined prompt using the DALL-E API.
4. Save the generated image as `my_img.png`.

Your Python function must look like the template below:

```python
def generate_image(prompt):
    """
    This function accepts a user's prompt, enhances it using the GPT API, then generates an image from the enhanced prompt using the DALL-E API, and saves it as `my_img.png`.
    
    Parameters:
        prompt (str): The initial user's prompt.

    Returns:
        None
    """

    # Step 1: Pass the user's prompt to the GPT API to get a refined prompt.

    # Step 2: Pass the refined prompt to the DALL-E API to get the generated image.

    # Step 3: Save the generated image as `my_img.png`.

    return None
```

*Hint*: You can test your code by calling the function with some prompts. **But** before submitting, make sure to delete the function call.
